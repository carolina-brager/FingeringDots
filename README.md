# FingeringDots
It's like twister, but with your fingers.

I thought of the idea of playing the game Twister with your fingers at a hackathon last year and decided it might be fun to implement. In the 36 hours of the hackathon I taught myself swift and managed to create a working, yet buggy, version. Haven't worked on it since, but keeping it here in case I ever do feel like picking it up again.
